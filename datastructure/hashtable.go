package datastructure

/*
	Go has its own implementation of hashtable, which is built into the language itself as a basic data structure.
In Go, we can create an object of hashtable like this way:
		var m map[key]value
		m := make(map[key]value)
	Bigo is designed as an efficient key-value storage server, whose efficiency relies on the hashtable behind it.
